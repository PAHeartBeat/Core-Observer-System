Introducing the Observer Design Pattern Utility

This project is all about providing a powerful tool for building systems based on the Observer Design Pattern, such as a Signal System. With this pattern, two modules can communicate and share data using a signal data structure, while remaining completely independent from each other.

In simpler terms, it's like giving different modules or features a way to talk to each other without getting tangled up. This decouples them, allowing them to work together seamlessly without causing any problems. Whether you're new to programming or a seasoned coder, this utility will help you create flexible and efficient systems.
